chainreact-clj
==============

A clojure version of the Chain Reaction Android game.

I built a version of the game on Javascript that is at http://madhuvishy.in/ChainReaction.html and the code is here: https://gist.github.com/madhuvishy/7711874.
This is an attempt to build a Clojure version of the same game to see how the design of the game changes in the functional programming sense.

To play the game, clone the repo, and run:

lein run <board-size> <number-of-players>

To play enter "row column" where the move is made (Yes, not sweet, but building UI's with Swing is not sweet either)

Example:

chainreact-clj [master] lein run 8 2
