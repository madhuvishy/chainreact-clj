chainreact-clj
==============

A clojure version of the Chain Reaction Android game.

I built a version of the game on Javascript that is at http://madhuvishy.in/ChainReaction.html and the code is here: https://gist.github.com/madhuvishy/7711874.
This is an attempt to build a Clojure version of the same game to see how the design of the game changes in the functional programming sense.
